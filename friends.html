<p style="text-align: center;">hello chadder and carterer and josephi and and me I just fixed the issue with typing clownclear.com not redirecting to www.clownclear.com and thought it'd be funny to make this temporary page I'm probably going to delete at some point because I'm bored but oink oink pig noises tddfhfdwdubhfburebmrgbgufrehbfrhberhrhhghhbyhbufrbwfyhbuwedfuyhwibygwhrhwegqfbweqfvbqwefbgqweqfbhu and I know you aren't going to be magically capable of assuming to type in clownclear.com/friends so when/if you're reading this (you probably are) I'll probably have had to tell you to look it up directly myself. Also, hello future ethan, I hope school sucks for you, long haired fat headed clown game making hippy boy, too bad you're so fat and stinky, anyway hingle dingle dergon. <br><br> Big toe little toe what do you do, you buy a toad and make it do your work for you (what) <br><br> Also I just spent so long trying to properly put this piece of text in the middle of the screen, HTML is so annoying for absolutely no reason, I'm going to put some funny images underneath this though because why not
